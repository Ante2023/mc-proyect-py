## Instructions:

Initialize List: Start with a predefined list of favorite foods. Example list: favorite_foods = ["pizza", "sushi", "chocolate", "pasta"]
```bash
 ~/Developer/Python/tasks │ python3 task2.py
 
My favorites foots are: ['pizza', 'sushi', 'chocolate', 'pasta']
```

Add Items: Use the append() method to add "tacos" to the list.
```bash
 ~/Developer/Python/tasks │ python3 task2.py
 
My favorites foots are: ['pizza', 'sushi', 'chocolate', 'pasta', 'tacos']
```

Remove an Item: Use the remove() method to remove "chocolate" from the list.
```bash
 ~/Developer/Python/tasks │ python3 task2.py
My favorites foots are: ['pizza', 'sushi', 'pasta', 'tacos']
```

Insert an Item: Use the insert() method to add "ice cream" as the second item in the list.
```bash
 ~/Developer/Python/tasks │ python3 task2.py
My favorites foots are: ['pizza', 'ice cream', 'sushi', 'pasta', 'tacos']
```

Use a Loop: Use a "for" loop to print each food in the list alongside its index.
```bash
 ~/Developer/Python/tasks │ python3 task2.py
0 pizza
1 ice cream
2 sushi
3 pasta
4 tacos
```

Sort the List: Use the sort() method to sort the list alphabetically.

```bash
 ~/Developer/Python/tasks │ python3 task2.py
List unordered ['pizza', 'ice cream', 'sushi', 'pasta', 'tacos']
List ordered ['ice cream', 'pasta', 'pizza', 'sushi', 'tacos']
```
